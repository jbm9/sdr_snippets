Some quick work on heuristics for finding channels of activity in a
data stream, extracting just the (much smaller) bandwidth of interest,
and then a trivial FM decoder.  Most of the channel extraction work
was cribbed from GNURadio's translating FIR filter, and the FM decoder
was taken from their code as well.
